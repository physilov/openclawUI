## Scope

Features to build and demo for the hackathon. Each feature is a self-contained milestone with clear deliverables.

---

## Technology Stack & References

| Technology | Role | Reference |
|------------|------|-----------|
| **Wordware** | Prompt logic and LLM workflow definitions — email triage, follow-up decisions, invoice generation, schedule negotiation | Wordware workflows define the decision trees and business logic that power each agent capability |
| **AG-UI** | Agent-UI protocol — real-time SSE streaming of agent state (actions, drafts, tool calls) from backend to frontend | `@ag-ui/client` + `@ag-ui/core` — event types: `RUN_STARTED`, `TEXT_MESSAGE_*`, `TOOL_CALL_*`, `RUN_FINISHED` |
| **OpenClaw** | Agent orchestration — multi-step workflow management, task routing, state management, context window injection | Gateway handles agent routing, dispatch, and reply pipeline across channels |
| **ClawGUI (clawg-ui)** | OpenClaw channel plugin that exposes the gateway as an AG-UI-compatible HTTP endpoint at `/v1/clawg-ui` | `@contextableai/clawg-ui` — bridges AG-UI clients (CopilotKit, `HttpAgent`) to OpenClaw gateway via SSE |

### Integration Notes for Hackathon

- **Frontend → ClawGUI**: CopilotKit's `runtimeUrl` points to `/v1/clawg-ui`; device pairing provides auth
- **ClawGUI → OpenClaw**: Plugin auto-registers as a channel; parses AG-UI `RunAgentInput` into OpenClaw inbound context
- **OpenClaw → Wordware**: Gateway routes to the appropriate agent; Wordware workflows execute the LLM logic per-task
- **Mock-first**: During hackathon Phase 1, the frontend uses mock data in `/data`; ClawGUI + OpenClaw integration lands in Phase 2

## Feature 1 — Setting Up Claw

**Goal:** First-run onboarding that takes a freelancer from zero to a personalized Claw in under 5 minutes.

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Screen** | Multi-step onboarding wizard |
| **Steps** | 1. Who Are You (name, business type, revenue range) → 2. Connect Your World (integration cards) → 3. Set Trust Level → 4. Meet Claw |
| **Key Interactions** | Progressive disclosure, one-tap OAuth connect, skip-for-now option, animated transition into dashboard |
| **Empty State** | If no integrations connected, land in guided empty environment with contextual CTAs |
| **Demo Deliverable** | Fully navigable onboarding flow with mock OAuth and trust-level selector |

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] 4-step onboarding wizard renders and navigates correctly
- [ ] Business type dropdown and revenue range selector functional
- [ ] Integration cards show connected / not-connected state
- [ ] Trust level selection persists to user profile
- [ ] "Meet Claw" screen displays personalized welcome message
- [ ] Empty environment renders with guided CTAs when nothing is connected

## Feature 2 — Integrating Gmail, Calendar, etc.

**Goal:** Connect external accounts so Claw has the context it needs to operate.

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Screen** | Integration settings panel (accessible from onboarding + settings) |
| **Integrations** | Gmail (read/send), Google Calendar (read/write), future: Stripe, QuickBooks |
| **Flow** | Tap card → OAuth consent → callback → confirmation badge |
| **State Management** | Track per-integration: `disconnected` → `connecting` → `connected` → `error` |
| **Demo Deliverable** | Integration cards with mock OAuth flow, status badges, and disconnect option |

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Gmail integration card triggers OAuth flow (mock for hackathon)
- [ ] Google Calendar integration card triggers OAuth flow (mock for hackathon)
- [ ] Connected integrations show green badge + "Connected" label
- [ ] Disconnect button resets integration to `disconnected` state
- [ ] Error state displays retry option with helpful message
- [ ] Integration status visible from both onboarding and settings page

## Feature 3 — Getting Daily Briefings

**Goal:** Every morning, Claw delivers a natural-language summary of what matters today — no digging required.

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Screen** | Daily Brief card on the Dashboard |
| **Content** | Natural-language summary: emails needing replies, overdue invoices, client follow-up gaps, today's calendar events |
| **Stats Row** | Quick-glance chips: pending emails, revenue this month, active clients, tasks due |
| **Interaction** | Tap any stat chip → jump to that section; tap brief → expanded detail view |
| **Timing** | Generated at configured time (default: 8 AM local); refreshable on demand |
| **Demo Deliverable** | Dashboard with populated daily brief card, stat chips, and expand behavior |

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Daily Brief card renders with natural-language summary from mock data
- [ ] Stat chips (emails, revenue, clients, tasks) display correct counts
- [ ] Tapping a stat chip scrolls/navigates to the relevant dashboard section
- [ ] Expanded brief view shows detailed breakdown per category
- [ ] Pull-to-refresh (mobile) or refresh button regenerates the brief
- [ ] Brief adapts content based on connected integrations (hides calendar section if no calendar connected)

## Demo Flow (Suggested Order)

```
1. Setting Up Claw
   "Meet our user, a freelance designer making $15K/month…"
   → Walk through onboarding

2. Integrating Gmail & Calendar
   "She connects her Gmail and Google Calendar…"
   → Show OAuth cards flipping to connected state
   → Mention: "Under the hood, ClawGUI pairs her device with the OpenClaw gateway"

3. Getting Daily Briefings
   "Next morning, Claw greets her with this…"
   → Show dashboard with populated daily brief
   → Mention: "Wordware workflows analyzed her inbox overnight via OpenClaw"

4. Email Summary
   "Three emails need attention. Claw already drafted replies…"
   → Show email triage, preview a draft, approve it
   → Mention: "Drafts stream in real-time via AG-UI — she sees Claw thinking"
```

## Mock Data Architecture

Mock data lives in `/mock-data` as a Firebase-style NoSQL in-memory database with 6 collections.

| Collection | Documents | Status |
|------------|-----------|--------|
| `inbox` | 5 emails seeded + 3 scenario-only emails added dynamically | Seeded |
| `calendar` | 6 events (calls, deep work, routine, prep blocks) | Seeded |
| `clients` | 4 client profiles with status and last contact | Seeded |
| `invoices` | 4 invoices (paid, outstanding, pending-proposal) | Seeded |
| `tasks` | 4 tasks with priorities, due dates, and linked entities | Seeded |
| `dailyBriefs` | 1 full natural-language morning brief with sections | Seeded |

The db supports `getAll`, `get`, `add`, `update`, `remove`, `query`, and `subscribe`. The `sendEmail()` helper appends new emails to the inbox at runtime (e.g. when the user clicks "Approve & Send").

**Scenario-to-Dashboard sync:** The Scenario page's "Next Step" button dispatches events via an event bus (`mock-data/eventBus.js`) that the Dashboard consumes. Each step narrates actions in the AI chat panel (typing indicator, then message), switches the active workspace view, and highlights the relevant email. The David Park thread (emails 01-03) is not pre-seeded — it is dynamically injected into the inbox collection as the scenario progresses, triggering reactive updates on the Dashboard.
